# Agentic AI with LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith and MCP server.

**1. LangChain ->** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

 LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

  - Development : Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.

  - Productionization : Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.

  - Deployment : Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.

**2. LangGraph ->** is built for developers who want to build powerful, adaptable AI agents. Developers choose LangGraph for:

  - Reliability and controllability : Steer agent actions with moderation checks and human-in-the-loop approvals. LangGraph persists context for long-running workflows, keeping your agents on course.

  - Low-level and extensible : Build custom agents with fully descriptive, low-level primitives free from rigid abstractions that limit customization. Design scalable multi-agent systems, with each agent serving a specific role tailored to your use case.

  - First-class streaming support : With token-by-token streaming and streaming of intermediate steps, LangGraph gives users clear visibility into agent reasoning and actions as they unfold in real time.

**3. LangSmith ->** is a platform for building production-grade LLM applications. It allows you to closely monitor and evaluate your application, so you can ship quickly and with confidence.

# MCP Server :

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
